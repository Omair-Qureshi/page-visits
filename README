What we are looking for: functionality, efficiency, readability and tests.

Use this test to demonstrate your understanding of OO and TDD.

Write a ruby script that:

a. Receives a log as argument (webserver.log is provided)

  e.g.: ./parser.rb data/webserver.log

b. Returns the following:

  > list of webpages with most page views ordered from most pages views to less page views

     e.g.:

         /home 90 visits

         /index 80 visits

         etc...

  > list of webpages with most unique page views also ordered

     e.g.:

         /about/2   8 unique views

         /index     5 unique views

         etc...
         
Tests are setup to use minitest and can be added to the `test` directory. To run use `rake test`. The log file to use in testing can be found in the `data` directory.

We primarily use minitest in our test suites, but feel free to use a testing framework with which you are comfortable with.
